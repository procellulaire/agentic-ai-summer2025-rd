Generate video using Veo

The Gemini API provides access to Veo 2, Google's most capable video generation model to date. Veo generates videos in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles, capturing prompt nuance to render intricate details consistently across frames. This guide will help you get started with Veo using the Gemini API.

For video prompting guidance, check out the Veo prompt guide section.

Note: Veo is a paid feature and will not run in the Free tier. Visit the Pricing page for more details.
Before you begin
Before calling the Gemini API, ensure you have your SDK of choice installed, and a Gemini API key configured and ready to use.

To use Veo with the Google Gen AI SDKs, ensure that you have one of the following versions installed:

Python v1.10.0 or later
TypeScript and JavaScript v0.8.0 or later
Go v1.0.0 or later
Generate videos
This section provides code examples for generating videos using text prompts and using images.

Generate from text
You can use the following code to generate videos with Veo:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
import time
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()  # read API key from GOOGLE_API_KEY

operation = client.models.generate_videos(
    model="veo-2.0-generate-001",
    prompt="Panning wide shot of a calico kitten sleeping in the sunshine",
    config=types.GenerateVideosConfig(
        person_generation="dont_allow",  # "dont_allow" or "allow_adult"
        aspect_ratio="16:9",  # "16:9" or "9:16"
    ),
)

while not operation.done:
    time.sleep(20)
    operation = client.operations.get(operation)

for n, generated_video in enumerate(operation.response.generated_videos):
    client.files.download(file=generated_video.video)
    generated_video.video.save(f"video{n}.mp4")  # save the video

Kitten sleeping in the sun.

This code takes about 2-3 minutes to run, though it may take longer if resources are constrained. Once it's done running, you should see a video that looks something like this:

If you see an error message instead of a video, this means that resources are constrained and your request couldn't be completed. In this case, run the code again.

Generated videos are stored on the server for 2 days, after which they are removed. If you want to save a local copy of your generated video, you must run result() and save() within 2 days of generation.

Generate from images
You can also generate videos using images. The following code generates an image using Imagen, then uses the generated image as the starting frame for the generated video.

First, generate an image using Imagen:

Python
JavaScript
Go
prompt="Panning wide shot of a calico kitten sleeping in the sunshine",

imagen = client.models.generate_images(
    model="imagen-3.0-generate-002",
    prompt=prompt,
    config=types.GenerateImagesConfig(
      aspect_ratio="16:9",
      number_of_images=1
    )
)

imagen.generated_images[0].image
Then, generate a video using the resulting image as the first frame:

Python
JavaScript
Go
operation = client.models.generate_videos(
    model="veo-2.0-generate-001",
    prompt=prompt,
    image = imagen.generated_images[0].image,
    config=types.GenerateVideosConfig(
      person_generation="dont_allow",  # "dont_allow" or "allow_adult"
      aspect_ratio="16:9",  # "16:9" or "9:16"
      number_of_videos=2
    ),
)

# Wait for videos to generate
 while not operation.done:
  time.sleep(20)
  operation = client.operations.get(operation)

for n, video in enumerate(operation.response.generated_videos):
    fname = f'with_image_input{n}.mp4'
    print(fname)
    client.files.download(file=video.video)
    video.video.save(fname)

Videos created by Veo are watermarked using SynthID, our tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated content, and are passed through safety filters and memorization checking processes that help mitigate privacy, copyright and bias risks.

Things to try
To get the most out of Veo, incorporate video-specific terminology into your prompts. Veo understands a wide range of terms related to:

Shot composition: Specify the framing and number of subjects in the shot (e.g., "single shot," "two shot," "over-the-shoulder shot").
Camera positioning and movement: Control the camera's location and movement using terms like "eye level," "high angle," "worms eye," "dolly shot," "zoom shot," "pan shot," and "tracking shot."
Focus and lens effects: Use terms like "shallow focus," "deep focus," "soft focus," "macro lens," and "wide-angle lens" to achieve specific visual effects.
Overall style and subject: Guide Veo's creative direction by specifying styles like "sci-fi," "romantic comedy," "action movie," or "animation." You can also describe the subjects and backgrounds you want, such as "cityscape," "nature," "vehicles," or "animals."
Veo prompt guide
This section of the Veo guide contains examples of videos you can create using Veo, and shows you how to modify prompts to produce distinct results.

Safety filters
Veo applies safety filters across Gemini to help ensure that generated videos and uploaded photos don't contain offensive content. Prompts that violate our terms and guidelines are blocked.

Prompt writing basics
Good prompts are descriptive and clear. To get your generated video as close as possible to what you want, start with identifying your core idea, and then refine your idea by adding keywords and modifiers.

The following elements should be included in your prompt:

Subject: The object, person, animal, or scenery that you want in your video.
Context: The background or context in which the subject is placed.
Action: What the subject is doing (for example, walking, running, or turning their head).
Style: This can be general or very specific. Consider using specific film style keywords, such as horror film, film noir, or animated styles like cartoon style.
Camera motion: [Optional] What the camera is doing, such as aerial view, eye-level, top-down shot, or low-angle shot.
Composition: [Optional] How the shot is framed, such as wide shot, close-up, or extreme close-up.
Ambiance: [Optional] How the color and light contribute to the scene, such as blue tones, night, or warm tones.
