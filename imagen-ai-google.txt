Image generation

You can generate images using the Gemini API with either Gemini's built-in multimodal capabilities or Imagen, Google's specialized image generation model. For most use cases, start with Gemini. Choose Imagen for specialized tasks where image quality is critical. See Choosing the right model section for more guidance.

All generated images include a SynthID watermark.

Before you begin
Ensure you use a supported model and version for image generation:

For Gemini, use Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation.

For Imagen, use Imagen 3. Note that this model is only available on the Paid tier.

You can access both Gemini and Imagen 3 using the same libraries.

Note: Image generation may not be available in all regions and countries, review our Models page for more information.
Generate images using Gemini
Gemini can generate and process images conversationally. You can prompt Gemini with text, images, or a combination of both to achieve various image-related tasks, such as image generation and editing.

You must include responseModalities: ["TEXT", "IMAGE"] in your configuration. Image-only output is not supported with these models.

Image generation (text-to-image)
The following code demonstrates how to generate an image based on a descriptive prompt:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
import base64

client = genai.Client()

contents = ('Hi, can you create a 3d rendered image of a pig '
            'with wings and a top hat flying over a happy '
            'futuristic scifi city with lots of greenery?')

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation",
    contents=contents,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      response_modalities=['TEXT', 'IMAGE']
    )
)

for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
  if part.text is not None:
    print(part.text)
  elif part.inline_data is not None:
    image = Image.open(BytesIO((part.inline_data.data)))
    image.save('gemini-native-image.png')
    image.show()

Image editing (text-and-image-to-image)
To perform image editing, add an image as input. The following example demonstrates uploading base64 encoded images. For multiple images and larger payloads, check the image input section.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

import PIL.Image

image = PIL.Image.open('/path/to/image.png')

client = genai.Client()

text_input = ('Hi, This is a picture of me.'
            'Can you add a llama next to me?',)

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation",
    contents=[text_input, image],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      response_modalities=['TEXT', 'IMAGE']
    )
)

for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
  if part.text is not None:
    print(part.text)
  elif part.inline_data is not None:
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(part.inline_data.data))
    image.show()
Other image generation modes
Gemini supports other image interaction modes based on prompt structure and context, including:

Text to image(s) and text (interleaved): Outputs images with related text.
Example prompt: "Generate an illustrated recipe for a paella."
Image(s) and text to image(s) and text (interleaved): Uses input images and text to create new related images and text.
Example prompt: (With an image of a furnished room) "What other color sofas would work in my space? can you update the image?"
Multi-turn image editing (chat): Keep generating / editing images conversationally.
Example prompts: [upload an image of a blue car.] , "Turn this car into a convertible.", "Now change the color to yellow."
Limitations
For best performance, use the following languages: EN, es-MX, ja-JP, zh-CN, hi-IN.
Image generation does not support audio or video inputs.
Image generation may not always trigger:
The model may output text only. Try asking for image outputs explicitly (e.g. "generate an image", "provide images as you go along", "update the image").
The model may stop generating partway through. Try again or try a different prompt.
When generating text for an image, Gemini works best if you first generate the text and then ask for an image with the text.
There are some regions/countries where Image generation is not available. See Models for more information.
Generate images using Imagen 3
This example demonstrates generating images with Imagen 3:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY')

response = client.models.generate_images(
    model='imagen-3.0-generate-002',
    prompt='Robot holding a red skateboard',
    config=types.GenerateImagesConfig(
        number_of_images= 4,
    )
)
for generated_image in response.generated_images:
  image = Image.open(BytesIO(generated_image.image.image_bytes))
  image.show()
AI-generated image of a robot holding a red skateboard
AI-generated image of a robot holding a red skateboard
Imagen model parameters
Imagen supports English only prompts at this time and the following parameters:

Note: Naming conventions of parameters vary by programming language.
numberOfImages: The number of images to generate, from 1 to 4 (inclusive). The default is 4.
aspectRatio: Changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. Supported values are "1:1", "3:4", "4:3", "9:16", and "16:9". The default is "1:1".
personGeneration: Allow the model to generate images of people. The following values are supported:

"dont_allow": Block generation of images of people.
"allow_adult": Generate images of adults, but not children. This is the default.
"allow_all": Generate images that include adults and children.
Note: The "allow_all" parameter value is not allowed in EU, UK, CH, MENA locations.

Imagen prompt guide
This section of the Imagen guide shows you how modifying a text-to-image prompt can produce different results, along with examples of images you can create.

Prompt writing basics
Note: Maximum prompt length is 480 tokens.
A good prompt is descriptive and clear, and makes use of meaningful keywords and modifiers. Start by thinking of your subject, context, and style.

Prompt with subject, context, and style emphasized
Image text: A sketch (style) of a modern apartment building (subject) surrounded by skyscrapers (context and background).
Subject: The first thing to think about with any prompt is the subject: the object, person, animal, or scenery you want an image of.

Context and background: Just as important is the background or context in which the subject will be placed. Try placing your subject in a variety of backgrounds. For example, a studio with a white background, outdoors, or indoor environments.

Style: Finally, add the style of image you want. Styles can be general (painting, photograph, sketches) or very specific (pastel painting, charcoal drawing, isometric 3D). You can also combine styles.

After you write a first version of your prompt, refine your prompt by adding more details until you get to the image that you want. Iteration is important. Start by establishing your core idea, and then refine and expand upon that core idea until the generated image is close to your vision.

photorealistic sample image 1
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake
photorealistic sample image 2
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake, the sun sets across the lake, golden hour
photorealistic sample image 3
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake, the sun sets across the lake, golden hour, red wildflowers
Imagen 3 can transform your ideas into detailed images, whether your prompts are short or long and detailed. Refine your vision through iterative prompting, adding details until you achieve the perfect result.

Short prompts let you generate an image quickly.

Imagen 3 short prompt example
Prompt: close-up photo of a woman in her 20s, street photography, movie still, muted orange warm tones
Longer prompts let you add specific details and build your image.

Imagen 3 long prompt example
Prompt: captivating photo of a woman in her 20s utilizing a street photography style. The image should look like a movie still with muted orange warm tones.
Additional advice for Imagen prompt writing:

Use descriptive language: Employ detailed adjectives and adverbs to paint a clear picture for Imagen 3.
Provide context: If necessary, include background information to aid the AI's understanding.
Reference specific artists or styles: If you have a particular aesthetic in mind, referencing specific artists or art movements can be helpful.
Use prompt engineering tools: Consider exploring prompt engineering tools or resources to help you refine your prompts and achieve optimal results.
Enhancing the facial details in your personal and group images: Specify facial details as a focus of the photo (for example, use the word "portrait" in the prompt).
Generate text in images
Imagen can add text into images, opening up more creative image generation possibilities. Use the following guidance to get the most out of this feature:

Iterate with confidence: You might have to regenerate images until you achieve the look you want. Imagen's text integration is still evolving, and sometimes multiple attempts yield the best results.
Keep it short: Limit text to 25 characters or less for optimal generation.
Multiple phrases: Experiment with two or three distinct phrases to provide additional information. Avoid exceeding three phrases for cleaner compositions.

Imagen 3 generate text example
Prompt: A poster with the text "Summerland" in bold font as a title, underneath this text is the slogan "Summer never felt so good"
Guide Placement: While Imagen can attempt to position text as directed, expect occasional variations. This feature is continually improving.

Inspire font style: Specify a general font style to subtly influence Imagen's choices. Don't rely on precise font replication, but expect creative interpretations.

Font size: Specify a font size or a general indication of size (for example, small, medium, large) to influence the font size generation.

Prompt parameterization
To better control output results, you might find it helpful to parameterize the inputs into Imagen. For example, suppose you want your customers to be able to generate logos for their business, and you want to make sure logos are always generated on a solid color background. You also want to limit the options that the client can select from a menu.

In this example, you can create a parameterized prompt similar to the following:

A {logo_style} logo for a {company_area} company on a solid color background. Include the text {company_name}.
In your custom user interface, the customer can input the parameters using a menu, and their chosen value populates the prompt Imagen receives.

For example:

Prompt: A minimalist logo for a health care company on a solid color background. Include the text Journey.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 1

Prompt: A modern logo for a software company on a solid color background. Include the text Silo.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 2

Prompt: A traditional logo for a baking company on a solid color background. Include the text Seed.

Imagen 3 prompt parameterization example 3

Advanced prompt writing techniques
Use the following examples to create more specific prompts based on attributes like photography descriptors, shapes and materials, historical art movements, and image quality modifiers.

Photography
Prompt includes: "A photo of..."
To use this style, start with using keywords that clearly tell Imagen that you're looking for a photograph. Start your prompts with "A photo of. . .". For example:

photorealistic sample image 1
Prompt: A photo of coffee beans in a kitchen on a wooden surface
photorealistic sample image 2
Prompt: A photo of a chocolate bar on a kitchen counter
photorealistic sample image 3
Prompt: A photo of a modern building with water in the background
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Photography modifiers
In the following examples, you can see several photography-specific modifiers and parameters. You can combine multiple modifiers for more precise control.

Camera Proximity - Close up, taken from far away


close up camera sample image
Prompt: A close-up photo of coffee beans
zoomed out camera sample image
Prompt: A zoomed out photo of a small bag of
coffee beans in a messy kitchen
Camera Position - aerial, from below

aerial photo sample image
Prompt: aerial photo of urban city with skyscrapers
a view from underneath sample image
Prompt: A photo of a forest canopy with blue skies from below
Lighting - natural, dramatic, warm, cold

natural lighting sample image
Prompt: studio photo of a modern arm chair, natural lighting
dramatic lighting sample image
Prompt: studio photo of a modern arm chair, dramatic lighting
Camera Settings - motion blur, soft focus, bokeh, portrait

motion blur sample image
Prompt: photo of a city with skyscrapers from the inside of a car with motion blur
soft focus sample image
Prompt: soft focus photograph of a bridge in an urban city at night
Lens types - 35mm, 50mm, fisheye, wide angle, macro

macro lens sample image
Prompt: photo of a leaf, macro lens
fisheye lens sample image
Prompt: street photography, new york city, fisheye lens
Film types - black and white, polaroid

polaroid photo sample image
Prompt: a polaroid portrait of a dog wearing sunglasses
black and white photo sample image
Prompt: black and white photo of a dog wearing sunglasses
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Illustration and art
Prompt includes: "A painting of...", "A sketch of..."
Art styles vary from monochrome styles like pencil sketches, to hyper-realistic digital art. For example, the following images use the same prompt with different styles:

"An [art style or creation technique] of an angular sporty electric sedan with skyscrapers in the background"

art sample images
Prompt: A technical pencil drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A charcoal drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A color pencil drawing of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A pastel painting of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: A digital art of an angular...
art sample images
Prompt: An art deco (poster) of an angular...
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 2 model.

Shapes and materials
Prompt includes: "...made of...", "...in the shape of..."
One of the strengths of this technology is that you can create imagery that is otherwise difficult or impossible. For example, you can recreate your company logo in different materials and textures.

shapes and materials example image 1
Prompt: a duffle bag made of cheese
shapes and materials example image 2
Prompt: neon tubes in the shape of a bird
shapes and materials example image 3
Prompt: an armchair made of paper, studio photo, origami style
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Historical art references
Prompt includes: "...in the style of..."
Certain styles have become iconic over the years. The following are some ideas of historical painting or art styles that you can try.

"generate an image in the style of [art period or movement] : a wind farm"

impressionism example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of an impressionist painting: a wind farm
renaissance example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of a renaissance painting: a wind farm
pop art example image
Prompt: generate an image in the style of pop art: a wind farm
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Image quality modifiers
Certain keywords can let the model know that you're looking for a high-quality asset. Examples of quality modifiers include the following:

General Modifiers - high-quality, beautiful, stylized
Photos - 4K, HDR, Studio Photo
Art, Illustration - by a professional, detailed
The following are a few examples of prompts without quality modifiers and the same prompt with quality modifiers.

corn example image without modifiers
Prompt (no quality modifiers): a photo of a corn stalk
corn example image with modifiers
Prompt (with quality modifiers): 4k HDR beautiful
photo of a corn stalk taken by a
professional photographer
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.

Aspect ratios
Imagen 3 image generation lets you set five distinct image aspect ratios.

Square (1:1, default) - A standard square photo. Common uses for this aspect ratio include social media posts.
Fullscreen (4:3) - This aspect ratio is commonly used in media or film. It is also the dimensions of most old (non-widescreen) TVs and medium format cameras. It captures more of the scene horizontally (compared to 1:1), making it a preferred aspect ratio for photography.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: close up of a musician's fingers playing the piano, black and white film, vintage (4:3 aspect ratio)
aspect ratio example
Prompt: A professional studio photo of french fries for a high end restaurant, in the style of a food magazine (4:3 aspect ratio)
Portrait full screen (3:4) - This is the fullscreen aspect ratio rotated 90 degrees. This lets to capture more of the scene vertically compared to the 1:1 aspect ratio.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a woman hiking, close of her boots reflected in a puddle, large mountains in the background, in the style of an advertisement, dramatic angles (3:4 aspect ratio)
aspect ratio example
Prompt: aerial shot of a river flowing up a mystical valley (3:4 aspect ratio)
Widescreen (16:9) - This ratio has replaced 4:3 and is now the most common aspect ratio for TVs, monitors, and mobile phone screens (landscape). Use this aspect ratio when you want to capture more of the background (for example, scenic landscapes).

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a man wearing all white clothing sitting on the beach, close up, golden hour lighting (16:9 aspect ratio)
Portrait (9:16) - This ratio is widescreen but rotated. This a relatively new aspect ratio that has been popularized by short form video apps (for example, YouTube shorts). Use this for tall objects with strong vertical orientations such as buildings, trees, waterfalls, or other similar objects.

aspect ratio example
Prompt: a digital render of a massive skyscraper, modern, grand, epic with a beautiful sunset in the background (9:16 aspect ratio)
Photorealistic images
Different versions of the image generation model might offer a mix of artistic and photorealistic output. Use the following wording in prompts to generate more photorealistic output, based on the subject you want to generate.

Note: Take these keywords as general guidance when you try to create photorealistic images. They aren't required to achieve your goal.
